	<h1><span style="color:#D11F3A">Audi</span> is slowly catching up with <span style="color:#418FC6">BMW</span> in the U.S.</h1>
	<div id="container">
		<p>As is shown in the graphics below, Audi’s core models are majorly in their later years of the generation lifecycle, except for the A3. This can be a reason that A4 sells unsatisfactorily. The all new A4 would be available next year, so we expect to see an increase on its sales. The Q7 is also going to be refreshed in 2016. However, it’s sales even increased this year, though it’s still behind BMW’s X5.</p>
